For example, the H1N1 virus caused a flu pandemic in 2009.</p><p>Similar to seasonal (regular) flu, a flu pandemic is caused by a virus that infects the nose, throat, and lungs.</p><h3>How is a flu pandemic different from seasonal flu?</h3><p>Flu pandemics and seasonal flu are caused by different viruses. Flu pandemics are usually caused by a kind of flu virus that most people have never come in contact with. That means it can spread very easily and make people very sick.</p><h3>Will the seasonal flu vaccine protect me against a flu pandemic?</h3><p>Probably not. Seasonal flu vaccines are made to protect people from the viruses experts think are most likely to make people sick during flu season. Since a flu pandemic is caused by a new virus, the seasonal flu vaccine probably won&rsquo;t protect you from a flu pandemic.</p><h3>Is there a vaccine that protects against a flu pandemic?</h3><p>If a new pandemic flu virus starts to spread, a new vaccine will be made to protect people against it. It&rsquo;s important to get the new pandemic vaccine once it&rsquo;s available. It can take time to make new vaccines to protect people from a pandemic flu virus.</p><h3>How can I prepare for a flu pandemic?</h3><p>The same steps you take every year to protect yourself and others from the seasonal flu can help in case of a pandemic. Follow these basic steps:</p><ul><li>Get a seasonal flu vaccine every year.&nbsp;Make sure everyone in your family age 6 months and older also gets a flu vaccine every year.</li><li>Avoid people who are coughing or sneezing.&nbsp;</li><li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or&nbsp;sneeze.</li><li>Wash your hands often with soap and water.</li><li>Stay home from work or school if you are sick with a fever or have other flu symptoms.</li></ul><p>It&rsquo;s also a good idea to prepare for a flu pandemic like you would prepare for any emergency where you might need to stay home for 1 to 2 weeks.</p><ul><li>Gather supplies, like extra food, water, and medicine.</li><li>Make an emergency plan for your family.</li><li>Write down important health information.</li></ul><h3>How common are flu pandemics?</h3><p>Flu pandemics don&rsquo;t happen very often. There have only been 4 flu pandemics in the past 100 years &ndash; but they were very serious.</p><h3>How serious are flu pandemics?</h3><p>Not all flu pandemics are the same. Pandemics can range from mild (similar to a regular flu season) to severe (with lots of illness and&nbsp;death).</p><p>In a severe flu pandemic, many people get sick at the same time. This can cause schools, businesses, and community events to shut down in order to slow the spread of illness. <a href=\"http://pandemicflu.gov/pandemic/about/index.html\" >Learn more about flu pandemics</a>.</p>"},{"Title":"Take Action!","Description":"Make an emergency plan with your family.","Content":"<p>Take steps to stop the spread of germs and to prepare for a flu pandemic.</p><h3>Stop the spread of germs.</h3><p>Take these steps to help stop the spread of germs that can cause the flu and other illnesses:</p><ul><li>Avoid close contact with sick people.</li><li>Stay home from work or school if you get sick.

Talking with your kids about sex may not be easy, but it&rsquo;s important &ndash; and it&#39;s never too early to start. You can make a big difference in&nbsp;helping them stay healthy and make good choices as they grow up.</p><p>It may be hard to know where to start, especially if your parents didn&rsquo;t talk to you about sex when you were growing up. The following tips and strategies can help.</p><h3>What do I say?</h3><p>Kids will have different questions and concerns about sex at different ages. As your child gets older, the things you talk about will change. Remember to:</p><ul><li>Talk early and often. You don&rsquo;t have to fit everything into one&nbsp;conversation.</li><li>Be ready to answer questions. Children&rsquo;s questions can tell you a lot about what they already know.</li><li>Listen carefully, even if you don&rsquo;t agree with your child&rsquo;s&nbsp;opinion.</li><li>Try using things that come up on TV or in music to start a conversation.</li><li>Be honest about how you are feeling. For example, if you are embarrassed or uncomfortable, it&rsquo;s okay to say so.</li></ul><p></p><h3>When is the right time to start talking?</h3><p>It&rsquo;s never too early to start talking to children about their bodies. Use the correct names for private body parts. To learn the correct names, check out these slideshows:</p><p></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/female-reproductive-system.html?ref=search#catboy\" >Female reproductive system</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/male-reproductive.html?ref=search#catboy\" >Male reproductive system</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Be sure to keep having conversations&nbsp;with your child during adolescence. Adolescence is the stage between childhood and adulthood. During this time, your child will go through puberty. Puberty (&ldquo;PEW-ber-tee&rdquo;) is when your child&rsquo;s body starts to change into an adult&rsquo;s body.</p><h3>Will talking to my child really make a difference?</h3><p>Parents are the most important influence on a teen&rsquo;s decisions about sex and relationships. Your child may want to talk to you about sex and dating, but may not know how to start the conversation.</p><p></p><p>Teens who talk with their parents about sex are more likely to put off having sex until they are older. They are also more likely to make healthy choices, like using condoms to prevent pregnancy and STDs, if they do choose to have sex.</p><p><h3>What do I tell my child about puberty?</h3>Puberty is different for each child.</p><ul><li>For girls, puberty usually starts between ages 9 and 13. <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000651.htm\" >Get more information about puberty to share with your daughter</a>.</li><li>For boys, it usually begins between ages 10 and 13. <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000650.htm\" >Get more information about puberty to share with your son</a>.</li></ul><p>Puberty can be a confusing and overwhelming time for many kids.

For example, a male child may feel like a girl, not a boy. And some kids don&#39;t feel like a boy <em>or </em>a girl.</p><p>When people act or feel like they are a different gender than their birth sex, this is called being &quot;gender non-conforming.&quot; Children may feel this way from very early on, or they may start to feel this way during puberty.</p><p>For some kids, being gender non-conforming is temporary &ndash; for others, it&#39;s not. Either way, it&#39;s important to let your child know that you love and accept him no matter what. <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Non-Conforming-Transgender-Children.aspx\" >Get more tips for parenting a gender non-conforming child.</a></p><h3>How can I help my child build healthy relationships?</h3><p>Families have different rules about when it&rsquo;s okay for kids to start dating. Whatever your family rules are, the best time to start talking about healthy relationships is before your child starts dating.</p><p>Start conversations about what to look for in a romantic partner. Help your kids develop realistic and healthy expectations for their relationships.</p><h3>Talk about opposite-sex (straight) and same-sex (gay or lesbian) relationships.</h3><p>When you talk to your child about sex and relationships, don&rsquo;t assume she is straight. Let your child know that it&rsquo;s okay to be lesbian, gay, bisexual, or straight &ndash; and that you love and accept her no matter what.</p><p>Lesbian, gay, and bisexual teens whose parents are supportive are less likely to be depressed, and more likely to make healthy choices about sex and relationships. <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/protective/pdf/parents_influence_lgb.pdf\" >Find out how you can support a lesbian, gay, or bisexual teen [PDF - 256 KB]</a>.</p><p>Get more tips to help you <a href=\"https://healthfinder.gov/HealthTopics//HealthTopics/Category/parenting/healthy-communication-and-relationships/talk-with-your-teen-about-healthy-relationships\">talk with your kids about healthy relationships</a>.</p><h3>What do I tell my child about preventing pregnancy and STDs?</h3><p>Make sure your kids have the facts they need to make healthy decisions.

Even if you think your child isn&rsquo;t dating or having sex, talk about ways to prevent pregnancy and STDs.</p><p>Tell your child about different birth control methods, like birth control pills.

Their answers will tell you more about what they are asking and why. This will also give you time to think about your answer.</p><p></p><p>Do your best to answer questions honestly and correctly. If you don&rsquo;t know the answer to a question, you could say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure.

This can be confusing for your child. That&rsquo;s another reason why it&rsquo;s important for you to answer questions clearly and accurately.</p><h3>Use media to start a conversation.</h3><p>Kids see and hear messages about sex every day in the media &ndash; like on TV, in music, and online. When something comes up in&nbsp;a TV show or song, use it as an opportunity to start a conversation with your child.</p><h3>Talk in the car or in the kitchen.</h3><p>It can sometimes be easier to talk about sex if you are doing something else at the same time. Try asking a question when you are driving in the car or busy cooking dinner.</p><p>You can still show your child that you are listening by nodding your head or repeating what your child says to you.</p><h3>Be honest.</h3><p>It&rsquo;s okay to feel embarrassed or uncomfortable. Be honest with your child about how you are feeling. Remember, when you are honest with your child, your child is more likely to be honest with you.</p><h3>Talk with other parents.</h3><p>Remember that you are not the only parent thinking about how to talk to kids about sex.

The flu shot is available starting each fall.","Content":"<p>Everyone age 6 months and older needs to get a flu shot (vaccine) every year. The seasonal flu vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and others from the&nbsp;flu.</p><p>For many people, the seasonal flu is a mild illness. But for some people, the flu can be dangerous or even deadly.</p><p>The flu can sometimes:</p><ul><li>Cause serious infections like pneumonia (&ldquo;noo-MOHN-yah&rdquo;)</li><li>Make existing health problems&nbsp;worse (for example, flu can cause asthma attacks in people with asthma)</li><li>Lead to hospitalization or death</li></ul><p>The flu spreads easily from person to person. When you get a flu vaccine, you don&rsquo;t just protect yourself. You also protect everyone around you.</p><h3>When do I need to get the seasonal flu vaccine?</h3><p>Get a flu vaccine&nbsp;soon after&nbsp;it&rsquo;s available each year &ndash; if possible, by October. After you get the vaccine, it&nbsp;takes about 2 weeks for&nbsp;your body&nbsp;to develop protection against the flu. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a good idea to get the vaccine before the flu starts to spread&nbsp;in your community.</p><p>Flu season can be different from year to year. It can start as early as October and last as late as May. Most years, flu season is between December and February.</p><h3>What is the flu?</h3><p>The flu is caused by viruses that infect&nbsp;your nose, throat, and lungs. It&rsquo;s easily spread from person to person when someone with the flu&nbsp;coughs, sneezes, or talks. It&#39;s also possible to get the flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>Symptoms of the flu may include:</p><ul><li>Headache</li><li>Tiredness</li><li>Cough</li><li>Sore throat</li><li>Runny or stuffy nose</li><li>Muscle or body aches</li><li>Fever of 100 &deg;F or higher</li><li>Feeling feverish or having chills</li><li>Vomiting (throwing up) and diarrhea (frequent, watery poop)</li></ul><p>Remember, not everyone with the flu has a fever.&nbsp;</p><h3>How is the flu vaccine given?</h3><p>Most people get the flu vaccine as a shot. A nasal spray is available but it&#39;s not recommended because it doesn&#39;t provide the same protection as the shot.&nbsp;</p><p>The best way to protect yourself and others around you is to get a flu shot every year.&nbsp;</p><h3>Are there any side effects from the seasonal flu vaccine?</h3><p>Most people don&rsquo;t have any side effects after getting a&nbsp;flu shot. Some people may have mild side effects that begin soon after the vaccine is given and usually last 1 to 2 days.&nbsp;</p><p>Side effects may include:</p><ul><li>Soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given</li><li>Low fever</li><li>Aches</li></ul><p>These side effects aren&rsquo;t the flu. You can&rsquo;t get the flu from the flu shot because it&rsquo;s made from killed flu viruses.</p><h3>Am I at high risk for serious complications from the flu?</h3><p>For some people, the flu is more likely to cause serious illness that can lead to hospitalization or even death.&nbsp;</p><p>People at high risk for getting complications from the flu include:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/children.htm\" >Children under age 5</a>&nbsp;&ndash; especially children under age 2</li><li><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/pregnant.htm\" >Pregnant women&nbsp;</a>and women who&#39;ve had a baby in the last 2 weeks</li><li><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/65over.htm\" >Adults age 65 and older</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/high_risk.htm\" >People with some long-term health conditions</a> (for example, asthma, diabetes, heart disease, HIV/AIDS, or cancer)</li><li>People who live in long-term care facilities,&nbsp;like nursing homes</li><li><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu/pdf/freeresources/native/protect_circle_life_factsheet.pdf\" >American Indians and Alaska Natives [PDF - 1.1 MB]</a></li></ul><p>If you are at high risk from the flu, it&rsquo;s very important to get a vaccine before the flu starts to spread in your community.&nbsp;</p><p>If you care for or spend time with someone at high risk from the flu, you can protect both of you by getting a flu vaccine.</p><h3>Is there medicine that can treat the flu?</h3><p>Yes.

Kids who bully use their power (like being popular or physically strong) to control or hurt others.&nbsp;</p><p>There are different kinds of bullying. Bullying can be:</p><ul><li>Physical &ndash; like hitting or pushing</li><li>Verbal &ndash; like name-calling or teasing</li><li>Social &ndash; like spreading rumors or leaving someone out on purpose</li></ul><p>Bullying can be done in person, online, or with other technology (like cell phones). Bullying usually happens over and over again.&nbsp;</p><p>Talk with your child about bullying &ndash;&nbsp;even if you don&#39;t see signs of a problem.</p><h2>Teach&nbsp;your child that bullying is wrong.</h2><p>Tell your child why you are concerned about bullying.</p><ul><li>&ldquo;In our family, we believe that everyone deserves respect. When you say mean things, leave other kids out on purpose, or push and hit, that&rsquo;s not being respectful.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to know what to do if someone is picking on you. If you ever have a problem, we can figure out what to do together.&rdquo;</li></ul><h2>Play the &ldquo;what if&rdquo; game with your child.</h2><p>Try asking your child questions, like &ldquo;What would you do if:</p><ul><li>...you saw someone getting picked on?&rdquo;</li><li>...someone sent&nbsp;you a mean text message?&rdquo;</li><li>...you hurt someone&rsquo;s feelings?&rdquo;</li></ul><h2>Look for the warning signs of bullying.</h2><p>Talk with your child about what&rsquo;s going on at school.

Encourage him to get help from a teacher or school counselor. Remember, &quot;fighting back&quot; isn&#39;t a good way to deal with bullying.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Help your child learn kindness and respect.</h2><ul><li>Encourage your child to participate in activities with other children.
